  <h1>TREVOR TOMESH</h1>
  <h3>TAUGHT COURSES</h3>
  <h2>
  <a href=" ">CS 207 - BUILDING INTERACTIVE GADGETS.</a><br>
  </h2>
  <h3>
    An introduction to building and controlling interactive devices for multimedia <br>
    art and DIY projects. Build robots, new musical instruments, wearable computers <br>
     and more. Learn about sensors and actuators: WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS; hardware <br>
     platforms such as the Arduino; and software platforms such as Processing.
  </h3>

  <h2> 
  <a href=" "> CS 290AJ - INTERACTIVE SIMULATION METHODS </a><br>
  </h2>
  <h3>
    In this course students will use the Blender 3D modelling suite to develop visually <br>
    stimulating - yet physically accurate - models in domains such as classical mechanics, <br>
     chaos theory, and complex systems and bring learning to life in interactive 3D simulations.
  </h3>

  <h2> 
      <a href=" "> CS 290AK - TOPICS IN DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS </a><br>
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Students are introduced to data collection techniques by developing their own sensor<br>
     modules, running experiments and verifying the results. Students will learn <br>
     microcontroller programming for data collection as well as regression techniques and <br>
    error analysis for calibration and verification. Potential modules developed range from <br>
    simple light sensors to fully functioning geiger counters. 
  </h3>

  <h2> 
    <a href=" ">CS 427/827 - COMPUTER AUDIO</a><br>
  </h2>
  <h3>
    The purpose of this course is to provide a broad overview of many areas of computer audio,<br> including: Digital representation and compression; Psychoacoustics; Surround Sound; Speech<br> recognition and Music Information Retrieval; MIDI and New interfaces for music; and video<br> 
    game sound. We will also explore modular interactive software environments such as Max/MSP and PD. 
  </h3>

  <h2> 
      <a href=" ">CS 807 - INTERACTIVE HARDWARE AND EMBEDDED COMPUTING</a><br>
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Hardware design for physical and pervasive computing systems. Wired and wireless<br> 
    communication protocols; sensors and actuators; resource constraints; location-<br>
    and context-awareness. Applications include: wearable computing, wireless sensor<br>
    networks, robotics and automation, internet of things. Embedded hardware platforms<br>
    such as ARM (raspberry Pi) and AVR (Arduino).
