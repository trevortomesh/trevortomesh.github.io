  QOTE
    > The good quote is 'The proper exchange of ideas between free individuals keeps tyranny at bay.' 
    & ...however media centralization and widely popular material escapism distorts societal discourse.
    > A the related quote is: '...the problem with hierarchies is that people stack up at the bottom and that they tilt toward tyranny across time'. 
    > Fuller context: 'If you're going to values some things more than others then hierarchies are inevitable. You have to value some things more than others or you don't have anything valuable." "Like beauty or strength or something." "Or competence. ...whatever it happens to be. The ability to play the flute. It doesn't matter what it is. Obviously if you value music you are going to value some musicians more than others because some are better. So you have to value things in order to more forward in life, and you have to value things in order to have something valuable to produce. But if you play out the value in a social landscape you produce a hierarchy. The problem with producing a hierarchy is that a small number of people are going to be more successful than the majority, and a very large number of people are not going to be successful at all - at that particular thing. It's inevitable. 
    & ...So you say "we have to put up with that because we need to pursue things of value". OK fine, so that is the right wing perspective - the hierarchies are justifiable and necessary. 
    & The left wing perspective is 'yeah but wait a minute, the problem with hierarchies is that people stack up at the bottom and that they tilt toward tyranny across time' and that's also true. 
    & You need that dialect in society between the right wing that says you know "we need the hierarchies and they are useful and you should be grateful for them, they structure you and give you form and provide value" 
    & and the left that says "yeah but they exclude people, people stack up at the bottom and that is dangerous to the hierarchy itself, it means that people might not have opportunity" and you have to say yes to that (too). 
    & The problem comes -and this is the situation we are in right now- where the radical left-ists (and this is mostly a problem that really permeates the Universities) say "Yeah but all hierarchies are just tyrannical power", it's like oh no their not. Hierarchies are based on competence in a functioning society and mostly our society functions... ...That doesn't mean that hierarchies don't tilt toward self interest and tyranny across time but that's a bad thing. Even a bad thing from a conservative perspective. There's room for the left because the poor will always be with us and the dispossessed need a voice, not least because there are talented people among the dispossessed and if they are stuck at zero everyone suffers because we don't have access to their talents. It's bad use of resources. On the right its like "no, we need the damn value hierarchies, we need to be grateful for our traditions and structures because they stop us from degenerating into chaos."'

    > Circular economy: 'is a regenerative system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimised by slowing, closing, and narrowing energy and material loops. This can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling. This is in contrast to a linear economy which is a "take, make, dispose" model of production.'

    > Memory Palace: 'the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops on a street, or any geographical entity which is composed of a number of discrete loci. When desiring to remember a set of items the subject 'walks' through these loci in their imagination and commits an item to each one by forming an image between the item and any feature of that locus. Retrieval of items is achieved by 'walking' through the loci, allowing the latter to activate the desired items.'

MARRIAGE
  QOTE 
    > 'Child of divorce, professional who dealt with divorcing couples for many years, Adult who went through a divorce, remarried and volunteer counseling/mentoring for couples today.
    & Here are the most common mistakes I've seen (my own as well as collectively) in the failed and struggling marriages I've seen:
    & One or both spouses have unresolved childhood baggage issues that will rear its head in their adult relationships. Examples of these include (but not limited to) physical or emotional abuse/neglect in the home; sexual abuse; one or both parents had substance abuse/addiction issues; one or both partners came from a divorced or single parent household. Among the many reasons why this is such a significant factor is if you grow up in a dysfunctional environment, you have no idea how dysfunctional and unhealthy it really is. To you, its normal, it is all you've ever known. So if Mom and Dad resolved conflict by getting drunk, yelling at each other and then not speaking for days, guess what you have a chance of modeling as an adult in your own relationships?
    & Understanding what "marriage as a priority" really means. When you get married, your marriage has to be the main priority in your life. Not your career, not your spouse (i.e. don't put them on a pedestal), not your kids, not your hobbies or your personal fitness. The fact is, when you get married, you no longer get to call all of the shots. Gotten used to staying up all night playing XBOX with your boys on weekends? Not going to work in a marriage for an extended period of time. You're going to have to accept the fact that if you want to have a healthy marriage, compromise is your new word of the day. In some cases you may have to give things up entirely, or learn to say "no for now." While this often tends to be more of a struggle for men, women can also struggle with this issue. I'm not saying that getting married means giving up you completely, or kiss all of your favorite activities goodbye. What I am saying is, if you want your marriage to be healthy, you now have someone else in your life who gets an equal (not dominant--equal) say in how you spend your free time.
    & Poor communication skills. A shockingly high number of adults lack basic healthy communication skills and conflict resolution skills. Its heart breaking to have conversations with struggling couples who won't speak to each other with a kind word for any reason. Both spouses should feel that their marriage is the one safe place in the world for each other. Unfortunately, in many instances, it is the last place a spouse can go for emotional safety. If you don't feel your partner is your first friend, your best friend, your most trusted friend, then something is broken in your communications with each other.
    & Vastly different backgrounds. Don't get me wrong. Anyone can be successfully married to someone else if both people are committed to it and willing to work on it. But most of the time, that's just not the case. Societal/familial pressures are real, and it is important to assess them if you find yourself in a relationship that is impacted by them. Are you dating a trust fund baby/very wealthy child and you are the Jack Dawson? Tread carefully. It makes a great movie, but statistically, Rose winds up marrying Cal far more often than running off with Jack, because she doesn't want to deal with the family pressure or get cut off financially. Sorry, that's reality, not the movies.
    & Similar to different backgrounds, different motivations in life. Do you know what your partner wants out of life? Do they aspire to be an artist who welds clown sculptures out of mufflers? That's great, but will it support the two of you, and if it won't, will you be okay supporting them while they're making Pennywise the Dual Exhaust Killer? Do they want to be a stay at home parent? Are you okay being the sole breadwinner? What if it is the reverse?
    & One. Union. Combined. Together. This notion is one that I see a lot of guys--especially high wage earners who are the sole income for the family--stumble over. Whether you are religious or not, the fact is when you get married you are no longer two individuals. You're one. The law sees you that way, the tax code (at least in the US) sees you that way, and society sees you that way. There is no such thing as "mine and yours" in a marriage. There is only "ours." The faster you get that concept nailed down, the better off you'll be. I've seen many marriages collapse just over this issue alone.
    & Marriage is not an event, its a journey. So many couples stop trying to pursue each other after the wedding day. Guys and girls do this. Stereotypically/historically, men tend to focus on their careers/making money; women tend to focus on raising the children and/or managing the household. (I realize not in every situation) Both spouses stop taking time to compliment each other, appreciate each other, go out on dates, weekend getaways, or generally just spending time chasing after each other. They take each other for granted and begin to drift apart. "We just fell out of love" is one of the most common phrases I hear in couples struggling, and the sad thing is, its one of the easiest traps to avoid.
    & Friends and family around the marriage. This is especially hard for people who come from dysfunctional families. When you get married, your new spouse automatically gets moved to the front of the line. In front of your parents, siblings, lifelong besties, etc. They're great to have in your life, but all of them have to take a distant back seat to your new spouse. If you're a guy who has had a doting mother all your life and she's told you what to do, who to marry, where to go to college, etc, you have a tough job ahead of you. The Monster-In-Law stereotype exists for a reason. If your new wife turns pale when your Mom's number pops up on your cellphone, you need to talk to your wife and find out what boundaries she'd like to have installed. If you are Daddy's little girl and nobody has ever been good enough in your Dad's eyes, its time for you to tell Dad that you're so grateful for his love and support, but Jim is more than good enough in your eyes, so you need him to be in his eyes, too. And sadly, if you have friends or family members who are toxic to you or your marriage, you may be forced to make a very difficult decision in your life. Anyone who sits around bitching about how much they hate their life, their spouse, their kids or how you're going to eventually feel the same way about yours--put distance between you as fast as you possibly can. We tend to adopt the attitudes of the company we keep. So if you spend all your time with negative people...guess where you're going to be mentally?
    & Date to establish trust. Time is actually your friend, not your enemy. Do not ignore ANY red flag you see in a relationship. Examine it for what it is, then determine if it is something you can work through with the other person, or is it something they refuse to acknowledge or deal with? If you're dating someone who is selfish and they refuse to see it, they will not magically become unselfish because you were kind enough to marry them. Red Flags ignored in dating will become the rocks upon which your marriage boat smashes in the coming storms. If there are multiple red flags and they won't talk to you about any of them, walk away. It doesn't matter if you've already moved in, share the bank account, the dog, and a car. Get out now. If they're not willing to work on things that impact the security of a relationship today, you can count on them not working on them after you get married.
    & Marriage is not easy. It requires a lot of work sometimes, even when you are both on the same page, have great communication, great sex (which will happen very easily if the rest of the relationship is healthy by the way) and great chemistry. People get sick, they get laid off, their family members die, children get sick, get hurt in accidents, friends have affairs, get divorced...life is challenging and it impacts our relationships, sometimes in ways we're not expecting or prepared for. If you're not willing to value your marriage above everything else in your life, its going to be really hard for it to survive the day in and day out challenges of living.'

SIBYLLINE BOOKS
  PERS : neauoire
  SRCE : Merveilles
  QUOTE 
    > A long time ago there was a small, but prosperous town in the middle of a great plain. The town saw plenty of foreigners passing through with exotic wears, stopping on their way from the great cities that surely lay far beyond the horizon. As a prominent way-point, the town found itself never in want, not only of the necessities of life, but of many of the luxuries as well. So one can easily imagine their reaction to the unsightly old hag who strode into the town on a bright autumn afternoon carrying a sack full of a dozen dusty books.
    & "All the knowledge and wisdom of the world," She said, "Only one sack of gold!" The men and women at the marketplace chuckled at the old woman. A whole sack of gold for twelve dusty books? It didn't matter what was in them, that was an outrageous price! Their own books usually sold for a gold piece each, at best, and that only for the highest quality binding and printing. A trading village was no place to sell books, besides, considering how busy everyone is with commerce all the time; most books were bought for show.
    & The woman tried to peddle her goods all day, but found it impossible to attract the attention of even the most credulous buyer. "Leave me alone," one would say. "I have plenty of books already," said another. "Obviously you don't know everything, or you would have left already" the more snarky in the town would opine.
    & Finally, as the sun was setting, the woman approached one of the other vendors and bought a bit of firewood. She dug a small pit, placed six of the books in, along with the wood, and started a fire right in the middle of the marketplace. This attracted the Mayor, who scrammed the woman out of the village, but not before the books had burned to ashes.
    & Winter came, and the town was hit hard by blizzards lasting well into March. They were a frugal lot, however, and always planned for such a contingency, and so they braved the winter well. Summer brought the normal volume of trade, and the town was back to normal by the next autumn, when the old woman returned again.
    & "Not you again," the Mayor said as she entered the town. "Are you still selling the same nonsense?"
    & "If by 'nonsense' you mean all the knowledge and wisdom of the world," she replied, "No. I now only have half of it remaining. I have changed the price, however." At this the townspeople nodded at each other sarcastically. Of course she's changed the price, they thought, because she only has six dusty old books left. "The remaining books are only two sacks of gold!" The woman sat down among the merchants and laid the books out in front of her, waiting for any takers.
    & "You must be joking," A man said, "You can't charge twice as much for half the merchandise! We are a trading town, well-versed in business and exchange. You can't expect us to buy books of such low quality for a price so high!" The woman merely sat there, and when the day ended without any takers - but with considerably more jeering than in the previous year - she repeated her ritual and burned half the books. The morning after the woman left, a few young people from the town ruffled through the dying embers of the fire, searching for an odd page, but all was ashes once again.
    & Another year passed, and this was a hard one. Again the winter was long, and harvests around the countryside were poor. The summer trading caravans were less frequent than they had been in decades. In the end, the city managed, as it always had, but there were whispers that another hard winter would spell serious trouble.
    & When the old woman arrived in autumn, she was expected. The Mayor greeted her personally, "Madame, we would like to look at your books. We will not be able to offer you two sacks of gold right away, but we are ready to form a committee to investigate the worth, and, in a few weeks, we will be able to make a suitable offer."
    & The old woman looked back at him. "These three remaining books contain a quarter of all the knowledge and wisdom in the world, and I cannot part with them for anything less than four sacks of gold."
    & "Four sacks of gold is out of the question, madame, but if you would consider our offer..."
    & The old woman simply shook her head, and proceeded to burn two of the three remaining books, leaving the town to fend for itself for another winter.
    & When she returned again the following year the town was desperate. Trade had all but ceased, and the granaries were less than half full. The winter was just around the corner, and already it was cold and windy, though the summer had only just ended. The whole town anxiously awaited the old woman, ready to swallow their pride and purchase her remaining book.
    & The woman entered the town cautiously, holding the book in front of her. "Are you now ready to buy my book. It contains one-twelfth of the knowledge and wisdom of the world, and it is exceedingly valuable. I can only part with it for twelve sacks of gold."
    & The Mayor looked back, "We had only budgeted for six." The woman started digging her fire-pit. "Now hold on," the Mayor said, "We can give you ten, but we need something to get us through next summer's trading season." The woman kept digging. As she placed the book into the pit, along with a little kindling, the Mayor finally gave in. "You win," he said, "We'll give you twelve. It better be worth it."
    & "It is," the woman replied. "You should have seen the rest of it."

  QOTE 
    > Important
    & "(This is the core of the bill: making sure people aren’t denied employment or housing, for example, because of their gender expression or identity. The pronouns stuff is supplementary, besides being misrepresented by Peterson.)"
    > Funny
    & "We should note that Peterson is very comfortable with non-binary approaches to categories he sees as forming the roots of civilisation — when it suits him. In another interview he says:"
    & "People often ask me if I believe in God. I don’t like that question. First of all, it’s an attempt to box me in, in a sense. The reason it’s an attempt to box me in is because the question is asked so I can be firmly placed on one side of a binary argument. The reason I don’t like to answer it is, (a) I don’t like to be boxed in, and (b) because I don’t know what the person means by ‘believe’ or ‘God’. And they think they know. And the probability that they construe ‘belief’ and construe ‘God’ the same way I do is virtually zero."
    > Summary
    & "The root dynamic of the clash here, though, seems to be between the fact that legislation like C-16 is specifically meant to protect a minority who often suffer at the hands of rigid categories that work for the majority, whereas Peterson’s general fight is with the radicalism in postmodernism which seeks to completely dismantle those categories. Peterson sees the latter at work in the former, which I think is a paranoid overstatement."
    > "In trying to get an easy-to-grasp handle on all this, it’s interesting that Peterson himself supplied me with the crucial tools. As with his opposition to binary ideas of belief in God, it’s testimony to the fact that he’s worth listening to for insight, even if you have to wade through some bile, and make some connections which he doesn’t manage."
    > "Peterson isn’t intending harm, or intending to undermine people. But — as he’ll be the first to point out in other contexts, e.g. communism — good intent is never enough. One has to pay attention to systemic unintended harms. There’s some truth in what Peterson is saying (alongside the distortions and occasional falsehoods). But even this truth is sometimes — especially in the transgender debate — blackened by a certain blindness."
    > Conclusion
    & "There are serious and present threats to stability and social cohesion, but they owe far more to shifts in economics and ecology than to shifts in sexuality and gender. Postmodernism needs critiquing, since, as David Kidner showed, it’s implicated in our ecological crisis. But it needs better, less blind critics than Peterson. And freedom and civilisation need better, more far-sighted champions."

  NOTE
    > "do you know the hand-eye relationship?""
    & the oscillation between liking what you do and hating it
    & anyways, there’s this period where you get more critical, your mind’s designer-eye-thing gets wiser, and your hand(skills) have trouble keeping up and you loose your faith in your own skills
    & so you look at your own work(music, art or writing) and feel like a noob, right?
    & but then your hand(skills) rise to the challenge, and you get better than your mind’s eye, and you feel happy with your own work
    & so now keep this in mind
    & this gets REALLY interesting when you know more than 1 craft
    & so let’s say you could skip these down hand periods by moving to another media
    & if you can only ever draw, cannot write music or write. Then you are subject to this graph, with no escape.
    & "knowing this biorythm is why I started to log, and my plan was to know exactly when I should jump to the next medium" - neauoire
    & "you chain the highs together by rotating" - sebastian
    & "there’s value in knowing when precisely you should hop over." - neauoire
    & I find that for me, music takes a lot of priming to work
    & If I give in to writing music whenever I feel like writing music, I only acumulate days of lesser focus
    & but if I wait 3 days after I had the initial urge, I get a day or two of focused music writing.
    & "ok so, 2 things, acknowledge the hand-eye relationship, and using that intersection to hop on over to the next"
    > "It's definitely not time, as you can get stuck in the middle of a low and never progress if you don't either persevere through or switch" - heapaepaemnunea
    > "You should also track other factors that could have an effect on your productivity: weather, diet, hydration, sleep, exercise, etc." - josh
    > "I think these other factors are going to affect the dynamic range of the curve, but not the curve itself (edited)" - neauoire
    > "The last time I tried logging (several month stint) I spent too much time doing the logging and ended up despising it... but at the same time of course weather, diet, hydration, sleep, exercise would effect productivity and reviewing that could be valuable T_T" - kor
    > "classic mistake
    & after a while, you have so much data, that it doesn’t really need to be so granular
    & like, my predictions don’t really change that much if I predict the curves from 500 days, or 5000 days back." - neauoire
    > "The explanation of 'stream switching at lull' makes me regret not starting years ago. The explanation helps *A LOT*. I also wonder if it works the same for everyone." - kor
    > "so during these lull periods I find it helpful to my "eye" to spend time perusing other art casually. My subconscious does the analyzation and compares my work in the background." - sebastian
    > "well the best indicator of that is:
    & while you are doing this other media, let’s say art, when you go back to music you’ll notice an improvement.
    & @kor I dont think it’s the same for everyone, but wouldn’t it be fun to find out what works for you :)" - neauoire
    > "Example:   Work on music while watching bladerunner in the background. Then when you get exhausted from music, Work on art the next day using inspiration from bladerunner and listen to similar artists in the background. Rinse and repeat." - sebastian
    > "Also, exercise is a funny one, because you can treat it as a skill as well as a general improver, so you can include it in the routine if that helps practicing it (getting into it and keeping it going), but you probably don't want to push it super high either unless you're going for athlete." - heapaepaemnunea
    > "i dont do pomodoro because i dont take orders from fucking robots" - floatvoit
    > "To add to the thread earlier in #the-lobby. The idea of rotating around different creative practices to match your flow and interests rang a bell for me. It reminded me of Jung's explanation of _circumambulation_. "There is no linear evolution; there is only a circumambulation of the self". It's mostly used in a spiritual context of finding enlightenment, and described as an orbit whose center is both the self and the goal. However, some can say that _the self_ is, in fact, partly the art that you are creating. It's an extension of you. And as a multidimensional person who has many different skills and interests, one can be seen as fleshing out the different faces of the self as they orbit through their varying interests. Your interests are different faces of the same object. Every time you make a rotation around the obelisk of _self_, you see a different version of you." - sebastian
    & "If the psychology can be mapped precisely. You can use the appropriate symbolism in a UI to help guide and prime movements in this metaphysical space and facilitate consistent workflow for users. This is one of my goals." - sebastian

    > Amor fati: (lit. "love of fate") is a Latin phrase that may be translated as "love of fate" or "love of one's fate". It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in one's life, including suffering and loss, as good or, at the very least, necessary, in that they are among the facts of one's life and existence, so they are always necessarily there whether one likes them or not. Moreover, amor fati is characterized by an acceptance of the events or situations that occur in one's life.

    > The hardest thing about logging, is logging itself, and to keep doing it. Optimizing redundant logs, turning them into quick codes, like the fh/ch codes to generate the task/hour made this whole process a lot more fun. Giving instant feedback, through dataviz for instance, was excellent too.
    > The biggest adjustment to my lifestyle, that I made recently, that yeilded the biggest difference, was to record more data. I've recently pushed this further, and started offloading almost all thought that goes through my mind at all time onto this digital paper. It has slowed time, helped me with focus and mindfulness.

ARTISTS SOLD

  QOTE 
    > Alan Moore: “In latter times, I think that artists and writers have allowed themselves to be sold down the river. They have accepted the prevailing belief that art and writing are merely forms of entertainment. They are not seen as transformative forces that can change a human being, that can change a society. They are seen as simple entertainment. Things with which to fill 20 minutes, half an hour while we are waiting to die.
    & It is not the job of artists to give the audience what the audience wants. If the audience knew what they needed then they wouldn’t be audience, they would be the artists. It is the job of artists to give the audience what they need.”

  TERM
    > Turbo: compressor forcing additional air into an engine to allow for increased fuel ignition and thus increased power output. A turbo has two halves, one is driven by the exhaust from the engine the other forces air into the engine. Negative 'turbo lag' time until the engine can provide enough exhaust to spin up the turbo compressor. 
    > Supercharger: Like a turbo but instead of being driven by exhaust gas it is driven mechanically (belt to engine). Negative  Takes power/efficiency away from driving engine output in order to drive the compressor.
    > Electic supercharger: fully electronically driven turbo (generally powered by a higher voltage (48v) seperate from car 12v). Negative  high electricity use.
    > Electic turbo: a hybrid electric-assisted turbo (generally powered by a higher voltage (48v) seperate from car 12v) using a DC motor to start the turbo spinning sooner to remove turbo lag or at low revs when not enough exhaust to produced. Once the engine is providing enough exhaust to spin the turbo the motor will stop output. It can also be a seperate electric supercharger working in conjunction with a standard turbo. Negative complexity.

I think looking for that common ground and then working your way back from there to see... now that we have that common ground where are the places that we disagree and can we identify why?

    > "If you can put together an argument which on the surface appears reasonable, but requires in-depth discussion to debunk, passerby will be reassured that your position is correct, and that the dissenters are just trolls. They won’t have time to read the lengthy discussion which demonstrates that your conclusions wrong, especially if you draw the discussion out like Moxie does. It can be hard to distinguish these from genuine positions held by the person you’re talking to, but when it conveniently allows them to make self-serving plays, it’s a big red flag."

COMMON GROUND UP
  DATE : 12018-08-11
  QOTE : "When we're exchanging individual sound bites or one paragraph arguments it's really easy to find ways to disagree with people and have lots of contention where as if you take the time to sort of engage in a little bit more a full way with a book or with a person or with multi paragraphs - the common ground is there if you look for it at all... I think looking for that common ground and then working your way back from there to see... *now that we have that common ground where are the places that we disagree and can we identify why?* Its just a so much more pleasent way of interacting with different ideas and different people than... saying OK my premise is that they think this and I think that and so we are in disagreement, now how am I going to defend my point of view..." - Anthony Aguirre

Typically this interaction is described as being conducted through a direct brain–computer interface, making these extensions functionally part of the individual's mind.

He was the author of two dozen books covering topics in politics, philosophy, history, urban affairs, and ecology. Among the most important were Our Synthetic Environment (1962), Post-Scarcity Anarchism (1971), The Ecology of Freedom (1982) and Urbanization Without Cities (1987). In the late-1990s he became disenchanted with the increasingly apolitical lifestylism of the contemporary anarchist movement, stopped referring to himself as an anarchist, and founded his own libertarian socialist ideology called Communalism."

We wander about the unknown terrains of life as novices more often than experts, complacent of what we know and oblivious to what we miss.

  NOTE 
    > 'Celestial Navigation in the GPS age'
    > "Personally, learning celestial nav, really added to my journeys, making me feel incredibly connected to the surface of the sphere we are rotating on, and within the sphere of stars we  live within. It has added a real 'beauty' for me, admittedly I am mathematical, and a bit of a hippy, but the added awareness of seeing stars move overhead as you move North and South, and over the equator, is pretty magic. 120 nm moved north or south changes all the angles of the stars you see, and the angle they rise at from the equator. (It's called amplitude) You can then really FEEL how you're moving over the surface of the globe. YOu can really start to 'feel' the spherical nature of the planet/galaxy/universe where we all live. You can 'feel' the equator. The world stops being flat, and becomes 'angles' and spheres. For me, I stopped thinking in terms of countries and boundaries, and just started to feel 'curves' and rotation."
    & "You're artists, and 'tech nerds', you are in a perfect position to understand celestial nav for its utter eye-opening magic. It's not just about working out a lat/long, it's about understanding your relationship on the globe to it's rotation, it's angle to the sun, the position of the sun and stars as they themselves move. Then picking a single magic moment, measuring some simple things, and starting to work out intersecting circles and lines."

THROUGH THE HEART

  QOTE 
    > “If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?”
    & "During the life of any heart this line keeps changing place; sometimes it is squeezed one way by exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish. One and the same human being is, at various ages, under various circumstances, a totally different human being. At times he is close to being a devil, at times to sainthood. But his name doesn't change, and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil."

    & "It was the aim of the geomancer to place every structure precisely within the landscape in accordance with a magic system by which the laws of music and mathematics were expressed in the geometry of the earth's surface. The landscape itself may be manipulated in order to achieve the harmony sought through the placement or adjustment, or removal, of trees or rocks, or bodies of water. Every feature of the landscape may be contrived to produce an effect which ultimately is perceived as beautiful; indeed, perceived beauty in a landscape may in fact be simply when the lines of the dragon current are in balance.
    & At the outset, a geomancer must locate the course of the major lines of the dragon current in his or her area. These days, it is claimed that such energy lines can be detected, and traced, through dowsing."

REGENERATIVE ECONOMIC THEORY
  DATE : 12018-10-05
  TERM 
    > Regenerative economic theory: "an economic system that works to regenerate capital assets. A capital asset is an asset that provides goods and/or services that are required for, or contribute to, our well being. In standard economic theory, one can either “regenerate” one's capital assets or consume them until the point where the asset cannot produce a viable stream of goods and/or services. What sets regenerative economics apart from standard economic theory is that it takes into account and gives hard economic value to the principal or original capital assets — the earth and the sun. We cannot do much to affect the sun although we can value access to the sun in such areas where access can be influenced. Therefore, most of Regenerative Economics focuses on the earth and the goods and services it supplies.
    & Regenerative economics is completely comfortable within the capitalist economic framework. Recognizing the earth as the original capital asset places the true value on the human support system known as the environment. Not having this original value properly recognized has created the unsustainable economic condition referred to as uneconomic growth, a phrase coined by leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, as stated in the book Reshaping the Built Environment.[1] The authors of the regenerative economic theory believe that uneconomic growth is the opposite of regenerative economics."

    > Dike: "To remove or disable a portion of something, as a wire from a computer or a subroutine from a program. A standard slogan is “When in doubt, dike it out”. 
    & The implication is that it is usually more effective to attack software problems by reducing complexity than by increasing it.
    & The word ‘dikes’ is widely used to mean ‘diagonal cutters’, a kind of wire cutter. To ‘dike something out’ means to use such cutters to remove something. 
    & Indeed, the TMRC Dictionary defined dike as “to attack with dikes”. Among hackers this term has been metaphorically extended to informational objects such as sections of code."

MONEY OUT OF NOTHING
  DATE : 12018-10-17
  QOTE : "Thus it can now be said with confidence for the first time - possibly in the 5000 years' history of banking - that it has been empirically demonstrated that each individual bank creates credit and money out of nothing, when it extends what is called a ‘bank loan’. The bank does not loan any existing money, but instead creates new money. The money supply is created as ‘fairy dust’ produced by the banks out of thin air. The implications are far-reaching."

UNCONDITIONAL LOVE
  DATE : 12018-10-17
  QOTE : "I know the secret to happiness. It took years of introspection, observation, and comparison, analyzation, insecurity, but I finally figured it out. It feels like it was under my nose the whole time. All you have to do is learn to appreciate the world. Appreciate everything. Love everything for what it is. Embrace the fact that everything has a reason, don't try to deny anything for the sake of being right. And after all, hasn't true love always been thought of as complete appreciation for a partner with no thoughts or intentions to ever change them? Unconditional love. I understand that term now. Because you realize that no matter how horrible a person's decision might seem, he or she has a reason for it. Nobody is a bad person, some just have a little more weighing on their conscience."

SBS 100F
  DATE : 12018-10-22
  NOTE 
    > Recommended operating temperature range for optimum life and performance is 20°C to 25°C
    - On constant voltage float charge systems the design life expectancy is 10+ years at 25°C and 15+ years at 20°C
    - Can be operated in the temperature range -40°C to 50°C
    - Battery capacity is affected by the discharge rate, end voltage, temperature and age.
    - Battery life is reduced by 50% for every 10°C increase in temperature.
    > Can be installed in any orientation except upside down (vents on the bottom)
    > Flame retardant (UL94 V-0) case
    > Gas emission is virtually negligible
    > Constant voltage chargers are recommended. The acceptable float voltage range is 2.27-2.29Vpc at 20ºC and 2.25-2.27Vpc at 25ºC
    - 13.62-13.74v float at 20ºC
    - 13.50-13.62v float at 25ºC
    - 2.27Vpc + 0.004 mV per cell per °C below 25°C
    - 2.27Vpc – 0.004 mV per cell per °C above 25°C
    > Recommended float voltage temperature compensation is:
    - 10ºC: 2.33 Vpc
    - 15ºC: 2.31 Vpc
    - 20ºC: 2.29 Vpc
    - 25ºC: 2.27 Vpc
    - 30ºC: 2.25 Vpc
    - 35ºC: 2.23 Vpc
    - 40ºC: 2.21 Vpc
    - The minimum charging voltage, at any temperature, is 2.21Vpc
    > Do not discharge the battery beyond the voltage cut-off limit for the given discharge rates: 
    - 1.80Vpc @ 10 hr rate
    - 1.75Vpc @ 8 hr rate
    - 1.75Vpc @ 5 hr rate
    - 1.70Vpc @ 3 hr rate
    - 1.60Vpc @ 1 hr rate
    - 1.60Vpc @ 15 min rate
    > Every six months maintenance
    - Measure battery string voltage
    - temperature
    - float current
    - inter-module resistances and internal ohmic values
    - if necessary adjust the float voltage to the correct value
    - The individual module voltages must be within ± 0.30V of the nominal float voltage
    - Inspect for contamination by dust and loose or corroded connections
    > The battery and ambient temperatures can be significantly different. Batteries have a large thermal mass, and there is a substantial time lag between changes in ambient and battery temperature. Sensors on the side of blocs should be insulated from ambient temperature. Place thermometer sensor:
    - Front terminal models - in the centre of the side wall of a bloc, in the middle of the string
    - Top terminal models - attached by a ring terminal to the terminal of a bloc in the middle of a string
    > There is no limit on the charging current provided the float voltage is set at the recommended value as the battery itself will regulate the current, accepting only as much as is required to reach float voltage.
    - Fast charge 2.38 volts per cell at 25°C (14.28v)
    - However, it is recommended that this higher potential only be applied until the charging current remains constant for a period of two hours. The voltage should then be set at the recommended float voltage.

SOLAR FUZES
  DATE : 12018-10-22
  NOTE
    > Why
    - Fuzes are to protect the wiring from damage in the case of a short or surge.
    - It acts as the weakpoint in the curcuit, so if something goes wrong it will break where you expect (the fuze) rather than heat up and melt/burn wires which can cause a hazard (fire).
    - Fuse on positive wire for convension's sake.
    - Fuse as close to power source as reasonable.
    > Fuze requirements
    - between PV and CC
    - between CC and BB
    - between BB and inverter
    > Fuze sizing
    - https://www.renogy.com/blog/how-to-fuse-your-solar-system/
    - CC to BB - match amperage of CC. 
    - eg: 30a CC = 30a fuze.
    - PV to CC - PV output + 25% rounded up to nearest fuze. 
    - eg: 24v 15a PV setup = 20a fuze.
    - BB to inverter - see inverter's manual. General rule: “Continuous Watts / Battery Voltage times 1.25"
    - eg: 1000W 12V inverter draws up 83~ continuous amps + 25% safety factor = 105 Amps, round up to 150a fuse.

JS PROMISE INTRO

  NOTE 
    > Simplified async function chaining (and error handling)
    > "A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The primary way of interaction with a promise is through its then method, which registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled."
    > Promise state can be:
    - fulfilled: The action relating to the promise succeeded
    - rejected: The action relating to the promise failed
    - pending: Hasn't fulfilled or rejected yet
    > A "settled" promise has been fulfilled or rejected
    & A promise can only be settled (mutated) once
    > Example:
    & img1.ready().then(function() {
    &   // loaded
    & }, function() {
    &   // failed
    & });
    & // and…
    & Promise.all([img1.ready(), img2.ready()]).then(function() {
    & // all loaded
    & }, function() {
    &   // one or more failed
    & });
    > Create promise:
    & var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    &   // do a thing, possibly async, then…
    &   if (/* everything turned out fine */) {
    &     resolve("Stuff worked!");
    &   }
    &   else {
    &     reject(Error("It broke"));
    &   }
    & });
    > Use promise:
    & promise.then(function(result) {
    &   console.log(result); // "Stuff worked!"
    & }, function(err) {
    &   console.log(err); // Error: "It broke"

  NOTE
    > Best to have some HTML and CSS to display basic content on screen
    > CSS, JS and HTML will load simultaneously but HTML gets a head start until the CSS/JS links are downloaded.
    > CSS should not render at all until the entire thing is downloaded.
    > You can inline some CSS for top of the page elements above the HTML CSS link embed if you want styling quick
  QOTE : "Getting something on screen as soon as possible really improves the user-experience"
  TERM : Progressive enhancement: Render a usable HTML website first, then enhance it once the javascript loads. Benefits: much faster load times for client, backwards compatibility, js not required.

JS SCRIPT LOADING

  TAGS : code, web, javascript
  PROJ : Memex, web
  NOTE
    > With two 'script src' tags: both simultaneous download, execution in order (if 2 loads first it will not execute until 1 has downloaded and executed).
    - The browser blocks rendering while this happens! Newer browsers will parse the page in the background and download upcoming resources, but rendering pauses.
    - TIP: put 'script src's at bottom of page.
    > '<script src="x.js" async></script>'. The 'async' removes the requirement to execute in order.
    > "async-download but ordered-execution" is possible, see article for snippit.
    > Suggestion is normal 'script src's at bottom of body.

    - I assume 'pairs' mean pairs of positive and negative.
    > ["cables that are bundled together generate a cumulative amount of heat, and have more difficulty dissipating that heat than when they are run individually. This is something to be aware of, but the relevant ABYC standard only applies to wiring carrying 50 volts or more, so it is typically a problem with AC circuits on a boat, not your typical 12 volt DC wiring installation. In general, if three conductors are bundled, reduce maximum amperage by 30%. If four to six conductors are bundled, reduce maximum amperage by 40%. If seven to 24 conductors are bundled, reduce amperage by 50%."](https://www.westmarine.com/WestAdvisor/Marine-Wire-Terminal-Tech-Specs)

    & Importantly, it’s missing (a) a quick survey of the strongest arguments for and against utilitarianism, and (b) much discussion of near-term vs. animal-inclusive vs. long-term views and their implications (when paired with lots of empirical facts). But those topics are understandably beyond the book’s scope, and in any case there aren’t yet any books with good coverage of (a) and (b), in my opinion."

  TAGS : bitcoin, blockchain
  TERM 
    > Blockchain: a distributed (p2p) ledger ("chain") of blocks of transactions with a dynamic-difficulty-adjusted brute-force key (next block ID) discovery system (used by the system's "accountants" called "miners").
    > Block Tree: "consists of all valid blocks whose entire ancestry is known, up to the genesis block. The rules for validness include no double spending, valid signatures, no introduction of more currency than allowed, ... These are the network rules, and every full Bitcoin node verifies them."
    > Active Chain: "is one path from genesis block at the top to some leaf node at the bottom of the block tree. Every such path is a valid choice, but nodes are expected to pick the one with the most "work" in it they know about (where work is loosely defined as the sum of the difficulties). Relativity and technological constraints prevent us from doing instant communication across the globe, so two nodes can not be expected to pick the same chain as the active one. This is no problem: the mining mechanism makes sure that the chance two nodes disagree about blocks in the past decreases exponentially as they are older."
  NOTE 
    > "Imagine that the blockchain is 210000 blocks long and TWO miners both find valid blocks within a few seconds of each other and broadcast them to the network.
    - This is perfectly normal as the Bitcoin network is peer to peer and global.
    - You now have two chains, each of length 210001. Neither of these are longer than each other. Some bitcoind nodes will see the first miner's block and some bitcoind nodes will see the second.
    - Temporarily you have two forks of the blockchain, each of length 210001 blocks long. They are identical for 210000 blocks, but the 210001st is different on the two forks.
    - Sometime later another miner finds another valid block, the 210002nd block, and that will be attached to exactly one of the forks.
    - This chain is now the longest at 210002 blocks and becomes the longest chain. It becomes the "definitive" blockchain.
    - (The transactions in the alternate fork don't disappear - they simply get put back into the pool of unconfirmed transactions and miners will put them into a subsequent block)."

  QOTE
    > "I think growing up is funny because when you're a kid there's this pretty strict hierarchy of kids and adults, or "grade 5 is higher than grade 4" and then as you grow, you become a teen and there's 'kids, teens, adults'  and then "kids, teens, college, adults" and so on and so on in this infinite fractal until it eventually becomes merely an amorphous haze.
    & and that haze, what we sometimes call "being in the real world" or some similarly inept name, just describes the post-schooling era where adults basically don't have any single agreed-upon hierarchy by which to measure themselves, so they invent new ones: career ladders, job titles, status symbols, income, moms trying to be "the best mom" by buying Baby Einstein DVDs, Tumblr inventing new obscure things to care about in competitive, performative social justice campaigns, 4chan inventing new things to hate in competitive, performative hatred campaigns.
    & ...we're all trying to quiet the existential maw of pecking order to some degree, through fitting in to existing structures or inventing our own.
    & my advice, in the end, isn't to pretend these things don't exist, but to pick the one(s) you genuinely want to fit into. I don't even think you have to pick one to fight upwards and 'win' - the existential searching part is simply not knowing _where_ you are, because even if you're in the middle (and most of us realize we're average) finally knowing _where_ is perhaps the most comfortable thing of all.
    & but I said it last night and I want to rephrase it a little here: a lot of people will just find that rock to cling to in the haze and then never let go / will be destroyed when they lose that part of their identity. I said that stagnation was the ultimate failure, but stagnation has to have some sort of relativity to be stagnant against. I think, in this framework and metaphor you have a few places to be truly stagnant while appearing to move and a few places to appear stagnant but are growing laterally, or existing in multiple groups and so forth, so perhaps my warning is just about self awareness and self honesty about that growth (which is really what all good advice comes down to in the end, eh?)"

  NOTE 
    - Use slashes for categories (ie: Button/Thing/Whatsit)
    - Use function and state for naming, not visual descriptors (ie: "Button/Primary" not "Button/Red")
    - Be consistent
    - "Ensure that nested symbols you’ll regularly replace (i.e. for different states) have the same text layer names. If you replace a symbol, it will persist any override text if it shares the same text layer name." 
    - Convention: Instance names lowercase, editable text (label, text in field) UPPERCASE
    - "Put any editable text on top of your groups as a rule. Then when you hit return twice to expand a group, you’re immediately editing text!"
    - "Your layer hierarchy is reflected in the overrides panel"
    - "Symbols which are the same dimensions will be available in the overrides panel as a replacement option" - useful for icons, and states (input field - norm, req, error, ok etc)

    > Resizing elements inside of symbols will be synchronized among 
    > All symbols should be re-sizable!*
    - Stretch = free transform
    - Pin to Corner = same distance from closest corner, or centered
    - Resize Object = obj change size but keep edge (margin) distance
    - Float in Place = tab-menu-like even spacing
    > Turn on "Pixel fit when resizing layers" in Sketch preferences
    > Control + 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 set resize rule to selected layer
    > Resize rules are excluded from 'Shared Styles'
    > "Text should be fixed, and aligned correctly, so that when you resize a symbol it maintains its position & padding properly. Text should have a “Resize Object” resizing property."
    > "Design the smallest version of a symbol. It’s easier to design around stretching Symbols than compressing them."
    > "Lock nested symbols to prevent them from appearing in the overrides panel. By locking nested symbols on the symbols original artboard, they no longer appear as an override in the inspector"
    > right-click => Set to Original Size

  QOTE 
    > "...my definition of magic - competence so much more advanced than yours with such alien mental models that you cannot predict the outcomes of the model at all."
    > "The way to extraordinary growth and changes often involes a fundamental ontological or 'lens' shift in how you see the world. Magicians are wearing not just better, but fundamentally different shaped lenses to the rest of us. And regardless of your skills and experience, it is likely that you are a magician to someone else."
    > "Meeting magicians is the first step to becoming one - when you are attempting to learn implicit knowledge that by definition you don't understand, it is important to have a bunch of examples in front of you to feed your brain's pattern-recognition systems. This will start to change your worldview without the controlling 'you' explicitly approving or denying every new belief or framework."
    > "Magicians or their work often seem to have a subconcious glow that I am drawn to, particulary if they use a type of magic that I recognise is on my critical path and thus something I'm currently seeking. Concrete steps I take to find them include asking my most interesting friends to introduce me to their most interesting friends, going down similar rabbit holes with bibliographies of books that excite me, and generally living in 'explore' mode at various points in life, while recognising that not every avenue will lead to a jackpot."

  FILE : 12018-02-01_INTJ_profile.pdf
  NOTE
    > All just 'introverted', or 'extroverted' states of four elements of input/output: mind, energy, nature, tactics. 
    > MIND
    - Introverted
    - Extroverted

    > ENERGY: how you see the world and what kind of information you focus on. Whether we prefer to focus most of our energy on looking for novel, intuitive connections or on observing and utilizing what we already see around us
    - Sensual / Observant (S): pragmatic and down-to-earth. More interested in facts and observable things, focusing on the tried and tested. Enjoy seeing, touching, feeling and experiencing. Significantly better at focusing on just one thing at a time instead of bursting with energy and juggling multiple activities.
    - Intuitive (N):imaginative, open-minded and curious. Visionary, more interested in ideas, focusing on novelty. Dream, fantasize and question why things happen the way they do. Always feeling slightly detached from the actual, concrete world.

    > NATURE: how we make decisions and cope with emotions. Mostly related to our interactions with other people.
    - Thinking (T): focus on objectivity and rationality, prioritizing logic over emotions. They tend to hide their feelings and see efficiency as more important than cooperation. Seek logic and rational arguments, relying on their head rather than their heart. Safeguard their emotions. Just as emotional as those with the Feeling trait – but they tend to subdue and override their feelings with their rational logic. 
    - Feeling (F): sensitive and emotionally expressive. They are more empathic and less competitive than Thinking types, and focus on social harmony and cooperation. Follow their hearts and emotions and care little about hiding them. These individuals tend to be compassionate, sensitive and highly emotional. Rather cooperate than compete but likely to fight tooth and nail for what they believe in. A decision that makes everyone happier is just as valid as a decision that gets the job done fastest.

    > TACTICS - work, planning and decision-making
    - Judging (J): decisive, thorough and highly organized. Clarity, predictability and closure, preferring structure and planning to spontaneity
    - Prospecting (P): Improvising and spotting opportunities. Flexible, relaxed nonconformists who prefer keeping their options open.

    > IDENTITY
    - Assertive (-A): Self-assured, even-tempered and resistant to stress. Refuse to worry too much and do not push themselves too hard.
    - Turbulent (-T): Self-conscious and sensitive to stress. Experience a wide range of emotions and to be success-driven, perfectionistic and eager to improve.
