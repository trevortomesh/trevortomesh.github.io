<h1>TREVOR TOMESH</h1>
<h3> PhD Student <br>
UNIVERSITY OF REGINA </h3>
<h2>HACKER (n.) A hacker is one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively <br>
  overcoming and circumventing limitations of programming systems and who tries to <br>
  extend their capabilities.<br>
</h2>

<h2> ACADEMIC (adj.) relating to education and scholarship.</h2><br>
  <h3> Hacking has its roots deep within academia. The first documented group of <br>
    adherents to the "hacker culture" were the members of the Tech Model Railroad <br>
    Club at MIT back in the early 20th century.<br>
  <br>
    An academic hacker is someone who seeks to close the rift which has formed <br>
    between hacker culture and academic culture over the years. In my research <br>
    and in my teaching, I try to emphasize the value in creative solutions to <br>
    problems, no matter how inelegant or bizzare they may seem. In the end, <br>
    it's all about having fun through discovery.
