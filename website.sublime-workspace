A memex is a personal knowledge base (see first link below). The idea goes back to VANNEVAR BUSH's original conception in his essay entitled \"As We May Think\" (quoted below). The software that runs this page is cited in the link above. Consult the index to the left to find the information that is relevant. I have decided to write my website in this manner because it is more conducive to the way that I think. I hope that you find some inspiration here! \n  QOTE : “Consider a future device …  in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.”\n  LINK : https://github.com/kormyen/memex\n  TAGS : website, about, me\n\nABOUT ME\n  TYPE : note\n  NOTE : I am a researcher, lecturer, and an academic hacker. I have BSc in physics and mathematics from the University of Wisconsin - River Falls and a PhD from the University of Regina (Canada) in computer science. My research interests include interactive hardware systems, constrained systems. simulation, analogous systems, games development, open source software, complex systems and general systems theory.\n  FILE : profilepic.jpg\n  TAGS : about, me\n\nLECTURER\n  TYPE : link\n  NOTE : I am currently a lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Regina in Regina, SK Canada. \n  LINK : https://www.uregina.ca/science/cs/people/faculty/tomesh-trevor.html\n  FILE : uofr.png\n  TAGS : about, me\n\nTWITTER\n  TYPE : link\n  NOTE : Follow me on twitter!\n  LINK : https://twitter.com/TrevorTomesh\n  FILE : twitter.png\n  TAGS : social, me\n\nLINKEDIN\n  TYPE : link\n  NOTE : Add me on linkedin!\n  LINK : https://ca.linkedin.com/pub/trevor-tomesh/51/724/5ab/\n  FILE : linkedin.png\n  TAGS : social, me \n\nGITHUB\n  TYPE : link\n  NOTE : Fork me!\n  LINK : http://www.github.com/trevortomesh\n  FILE : github.png\n  TAGS : social, me  \n\nACADEMIC HACKING\n  TYPE : NOTE\n  NOTE : HACKER (n.) A hacker is one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming and circumventing limitations of programming systems and who tries to extend their capabilities. ACADEMIC (adj.) relating to education and scholarship. Hacking has its roots deep within academia. The first documented group of adherents to the \"hacker culture\" were the members of the Tech Model Railroad Club at MIT back in the early 20th century. An academic hacker is someone who seeks to close the rift which has formed between hacker culture and academic culture over the years. In my research and in my teaching, I try to emphasize the value in creative solutions to problems, no matter how inelegant or bizarre they may seem. In the end, it's all about having fun through discovery. For more information read Steven Levey's book \"Hackers: Heroes of the Computer revolution\".\n  TAGS : philosophy, hacking, history\n  \nFREE AS IN FREEDOM\n  TYPE : NOTE\n  NOTE : Free People, Free Markets, Free Software. \n  TAGS : philosophy\n\nA SLACKER'S GUIDE TO GETTING INTO GRAD SCHOOL\n  TYPE : FILE\n  NOTE : An essay that I wrote a while back on my experience getting into graduate school.\n  LINK : https://github.com/trevortomesh/trevortomesh.github.io/blob/master/grad.pdf  \n  TAGS : writing\n\nCNC LECTURE\n  TYPE : lecture\n  LINK : https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gLWWMLXCt5wgE3wvqwF1U05FG3RnNggC1lM4K9ssGtg/edit?usp=sharing\n  NOTE : Lecture slides on CNC machines.
