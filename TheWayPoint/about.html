    <h2>A Journey Through Faith and Technology</h2>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to <em>The WayPoint</em>. I’m Dr. Trevor M. Tomesh, a computer science professor and a lifelong learner at the intersection of faith, technology, and education. My journey through faith and academia has led me to explore how these seemingly distinct fields can complement and enrich each other. This page serves as a personal project and a digital sanctuary where I gather resources, reflect, and explore ideas that merge Catholic teachings with modern advancements in technology.</p>

  <!-- Why I Created The WayPoint Section -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Why I Created The WayPoint</h2>
    <p>The WayPoint is more than just a website; it’s a reflection of my mission to serve. Inspired by the motto “As one who serves,” I aim to use my skills in computer science and my commitment to Catholic faith to create a space that supports both spiritual and intellectual growth. In today’s fast-paced digital world, I see a unique opportunity to leverage technology—especially tools like large language models (LLMs)—to make faith-based resources more accessible, interactive, and thought-provoking.</p>
    <blockquote>“Technology, when used with purpose, can illuminate the path of faith.”</blockquote>

  <!-- Educational Philosophy Section -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Blending Faith with Education</h2>
    <p>As a professor, I constantly strive to connect my teachings in computer science with the values and principles that guide my life. This approach allows me to explore new ways of understanding faith and to foster an environment where learning and spirituality coexist harmoniously. <em>The WayPoint</em> is one of the ways I express this philosophy, bringing together articles, reflections, and educational resources that explore Catholic teachings, ethics, and virtues in the context of modern advancements.</p>

  <!-- Inspirations Section -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Inspirations</h2>
    <p>Throughout my life, I have drawn inspiration from numerous figures who embody both intellectual and spiritual courage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Christ as Teacher</strong>: The ultimate example of guidance and compassion.</li>
      <li><strong>Dr. Jordan Peterson</strong>: His exploration of faith, meaning, and personal responsibility encourages me to seek deeper truths.</li>
      <li><strong>Pope St. John Paul II</strong>: A role model for living out Catholic teachings on human dignity, love, and truth.</li>
      <li><strong>J.R.R. Tolkien</strong>: His imaginative works, deeply rooted in Catholicism, inspire me to merge creativity with faith.</li>
      <li><strong>Georges Lemaître</strong>: The Catholic priest and physicist who proposed the Big Bang theory, demonstrating that faith and science can coexist harmoniously.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- The Role of Technology Section -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>The Role of Technology in Faith</h2>
    <p>Technology has the potential to transform how we experience and share faith. Through <em>The WayPoint</em>, I explore how LLMs, digital resources, and interactive tools can support spiritual reflection and growth. By leveraging the capabilities of AI, I aim to create resources that not only provide information but also encourage introspection, education, and a deeper connection to Catholic teachings.</p>
