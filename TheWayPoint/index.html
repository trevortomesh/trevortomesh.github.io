    <h2>Welcome to The WayPoint</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <em>The WayPoint</em>, a personal project and hobby page created by Dr. Trevor M. Tomesh. As a computer science professor deeply interested in the intersections of faith, technology, and large language models like ChatGPT, this site serves as a space to collect, build, and reflect. Here, I share tools and resources that help me explore Catholic teachings and ideas, all collected in one place as a digital notebook of sorts. I hope my journey, though deeply personal, might offer guidance, inspiration, or support to others seeking to blend faith with modern technology.</p>

  <!-- About Section -->
  <section class="section about">
    <h2>About The WayPoint</h2>
    <p>I began <em>The WayPoint</em> to bring together my interests in Catholicism, technology, and teaching. Inspired by the motto "As one who serves," I wanted a space to grow spiritually and intellectually by exploring the intersections between these domains. In an increasingly digital age, where artificial intelligence and automation shape many facets of life, I’m particularly fascinated by how tools like ChatGPT can support spiritual growth, reflection, and understanding.</p>
    <h3>Influences</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Christ as a Teacher</strong> – the ultimate model of guidance and compassion.</li>
      <li><strong>Dr. Jordan Peterson</strong> – for insights on faith and personal responsibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Pope St. John Paul II</strong> – an icon of wisdom and dedication to truth.</li>
      <li><strong>J.R.R. Tolkien</strong> – for his blending of Catholic values with storytelling, imagination, and mythology.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These mentors and teachings guide me as I seek to serve and inspire both my students and myself through faith and learning.</p>

  <!-- How to Use the Site Section -->
  <section class="section usage">
    <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>
    <p><em>The WayPoint</em> is ultimately my personal workspace – a place to compile resources that deepen my faith and help me explore new ways to serve. However, if any of these tools or reflections resonate with you, I welcome you to make use of them. <em>The WayPoint</em> is as much a journey as it is a destination, and anyone interested in Catholicism, technology, or faith is welcome here.</p>
