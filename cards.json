Much like the visual hierarchy that emerges when taking notes on paper, ANN employs arrows with increasing dashes to mirror the indentation that naturally occurs in handwritten lists and outlines. This unique design choice enhances the understanding of data relationships, allowing users to intuitively grasp the nesting depth of elements. Furthermore, the use of pipes and precise alignment evokes the disciplined layout often found in handwritten notes, where each element's positioning contributes to a harmonious overall structure. By bridging the gap between the tactile experience of handwritten annotations and the digital realm, ANN introduces a sense of human touch and organization that resonates with the way we naturally organize and comprehend information on paper.",
