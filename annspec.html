  <h1>Arrow Notes Notation (ANN) Format Specification</h1>

  <p>
    Arrow Notes Notation (ANN) is a lightweight and human-readable 
    serialization format designed to represent structured data intuitively. 
    With its distinctive arrow-based syntax and increasing dashes for deeper 
    nesting, ANN simplifies data representation for configuration files, 
    documentation, and human-readable data exchange.

    ANN is inspired by my own analog note-taking methodology. 
  </p>

  <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>

  <h3>Arrows</h3>
  <p>
    Arrows (<code>-&gt;</code>) are the foundational elements of ANN. 
    They mark the start of a new data element and visually convey 
    its nesting depth. Arrows are accompanied by an increasing number 
    of dashes (<code>-</code>) as you descend deeper into the data structure, 
    providing a clear indication of hierarchy.
  </p>

  <h3>Indentation</h3>
  <p>
    Indentation in ANN visually depicts nested elements. 
    It consists of a pipe (<code>|</code>) character followed 
    by a dash (<code>-</code>), forming a consistent pattern 
    (<code>|-&gt;</code>, <code>|--&gt;</code>, <code>|---&gt;</code>, 
    and so on) that enhances readability. This is meant to signify a 
    bent arrow â†³. 
    Indentation is fundamental to recognizing the hierarchical 
    relationships within the data.

    A pipe must always line up with the first character of the parent
    element. For example:
  <pre>
-> person
   |-> name = "Alice"
  </pre>
  </p>

  <h3>Key-Value Pairs</h3>
  <p>
    Key-value pairs form the core of ANN's data representation. They consist of a key and its associated value, separated by an equal sign (<code>=</code>). There are no spaces around the equal sign, preserving the format's clean and succinct nature.
  </p>

  <h2>Syntax Rules</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Each line in the ANN format represents a distinct data element.</li>
    <li>Arrows (<code>-&gt;</code>) signify the start of a new data element.</li>
    <li>A pipe (|) indicates a nested element.</li>
    <li>Indentation with an increasing number of dashes (<code>-</code>) indicates the nesting level of objects and values.</li>
    <li>A child element's pipe must match up with the first character of the parent element.</li>
    <li>Key-value pairs are denoted by the equal sign (<code>=</code>).</li>
    <li>Strings are enclosed within double quotes (<code>" "</code>).</li>
    <li>Boolean values are expressed as <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Examples</h2>

  <h3>Example 1: Simple Key-Value Pairs</h3>
  <pre>
-> name = "John"
-> age = 30
-> is_student = true
  </pre>

  <h3>Example 2: Nested Objects</h3>
  <pre>
-> person
   |-> name = "Alice"
   |-> age = 25
   |-> address
       |--> street = "123 Main St"
       |--> city = "EONville"
  </pre>

  <h3>Example 3: Arrays</h3>
  <pre>
-> numbers = 1 2 3 4 5
  </pre>

  <h3>Example 4: Complex Nesting</h3>
  <pre>
-> data
   |-> category
       |--> type = "A"
       |--> items = item1 item2 item3
   |-> settings
   |-> enable_feature = true
   |-> threshold = 0.5
  </pre>

  <h2>Usage and Considerations</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>ANN excels in human-readable data representation. Although it can be programmatically parsed, it may not match the efficiency of formats like JSON or XML for machine communication.</li>
    <li>ANN thrives in scenarios with relatively simple data structures, prioritizing readability.</li>
    <li>For intricate and complex data scenarios, JSON, XML, or established serialization formats are more suitable.</li>
    <li>Consistent indentation is pivotal for accurately conveying nesting hierarchy, with dashes' increasing count providing an additional visual cue.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    Arrow Notes Notation (ANN) introduces an intuitive approach to structured data representation. Through its arrow-based syntax with increasing dashes, ANN enhances human comprehension, making it a valuable choice for situations demanding readability and quick data understanding.
